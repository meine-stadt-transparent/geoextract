Extraction of locations from free-form text.

class WindowExtractor(Extractor):
    '''
    Base class for extractors based on sliding windows.

    A common problem when extracting potential locations from a text is
    that names of streets and cities often contain spaces. Faced with a
    sequence of words, the extractor then has to decide how many of them
    may belong to a name. This often leads to matches which contain too
    many words. For example, in the text ``"We meet at 7 Bay Road in the
    morning"``, we might end up matching not only ``Bay Road`` but ``Bay
    Road in the`` or more. While such overly long matches can often be
    quickly eliminated during validation they potentially prevent
    shorter, correct matches from being registered at all.

    To avoid this problem, subclasses of this class scan the text
    multiple times using windows of a varying number of space-separated
    words::

        We meet               #
        meet at               #
        ...                   # groups of 2 words
        in the                #
        the morning           #

        We meet at            #
        meet at 7             #
        ...                   # groups of 3 words
        Road in the           #
        in the morning        #

        We meet at 7          #
        meet at 7 Bay         #
        ...                   #  groups of 4 words
        Bay Road in the       #
        Road in the morning   #

        ...

    This ensures that shorter combinations also have the chance of being
    matched. Obviously this doesn't prevent the incorrect longer groups
    of being matched, too. As mentioned before those need to be
    eliminated in a second validation step.

    You can change the minimum and maximum group size via the
    constructor arguments ``start_len`` and ``stop_len``.
    '''
    def __init__(self, start_len, stop_len):
        '''
        Constructor.

        ``start_len`` and ``stop_len`` specify the minimum and maximimum
        (both inclusive) number of space-separated words in the sliding
        windows. Unless you're matching single words using your patterns
        you shouldn't reduce ``start_len`` (a fast way of extracting
        fixed strings is provided by ``NameExtractor``). The value of
        ``stop_len`` should match the maximum number of space-separated
        tokens that you expect in your locations. For example, if you're
        looking for locations of the form ``<name> + <number>`` and
        ``name`` may contain up to 3 spaces then set ``stop_len=4`` to
        check windows with up to 4 words.
